data(RcmdrTestDrive)

## a. Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.

Gender = RcmdrTestDrive$gender
Salary = RcmdrTestDrive$salary
smoking = RcmdrTestDrive$smoking
mydata <- data.frame(Gender, Salary,smoking)
library(tidyverse)

Salary_summmary <- mydata %>%
  select(Gender, Salary,smoking) %>%
  group_by(Gender,smoking) %>%
  summarize(averaged.ES = mean(Salary))
Salary_summmary

##b. Which gender has the highest mean salary?
x <- Salary_summmary[Salary_summmary$averaged.ES == max(Salary_summmary$averaged.ES), ]
paste(x$Gender)

##c. Report the highest mean salary.
paste(x$averaged.ES)
#OR
maximum_salary = max(Salary_summmary$averaged.ES)
maximum_salary 

## d. Compare the spreads for the genders by calculating the standard deviation of salary by gender.
Gender_summmary <- mydata %>%
  select(Gender, Salary) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(
    sd.ES = sd(Salary))
Gender_summmary
plot(Gender_summmary)
